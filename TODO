Next release:

• test koji release
• re-examine --no-cleanup
• mock setup error checking (mock installed, user in group)

Lesser Priority:

• detect conflicts in fedora git merges
∘ drop to shell and allow resolution
• add a koji scratch builder
• write functional tests for the yum releaser
• scratch builder for koji/brew (can we re-use existing koji builder?)
• test scratch builds
• tito tag --use-version (instead of forcing to edit spec file)
• SRPM repos?
- Use proper temp dirs, not ones that will get re-used.

Someday:

• cleanup the parameters to builders, not all that config is really needed
∘ same for releasers?
• tito tag should warn not to git pull --rebase
• fail early if no brew is installed
• revamp output, use python logging framework, write a nice log somewhere
• live output/logging of long commands?
• re-examine the use of build_dir, why must it be passed from CLI?
