To run all tests, install the python-nose package and from the root of the
project:

    ./runtests.py



When developing code for tito there are a couple ways you can test:

"bin/tito-dev" is a script that will run code from the local checkout
rather than what is installed on the system.

And of course, you can always use the installed tito to replace itself with a test build of the latest *committed* code in your git HEAD.

    tito build --rpm --test -i

If you screw anything up inside tito itself, you can just:

    rpm -e tito
    yum install tito
